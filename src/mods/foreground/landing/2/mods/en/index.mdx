## What is it?

<div className="h-2"/>

Our killer feature is a built-in implementation of the Tor network protocol. We make all your network requests go through Tor, such that the people at the end of the pipe can't use your IP address to track you or censor you.

## How does it work?

<div className="h-2"/>

When your wallet sends a network request, it chooses a random Tor circuit to send the request through. This means that when you use multiple wallet addresses, each one will use a different circuit, so that the people at the end of the pipe can't link your different addresses together. The UX is specially crafted in a way that it won't fetch any data for multiple addresses at the same time.

## One more thing

<div className="h-2"/>

Even more, we made custom implementations of WalletConnect and Ledger, so that they don't leak any data to the network and can't be used to track you, we also made sure to fix all the security vulnerabilities and performance issues that we found in the original implementations.
