### Encrypted storage

Your storage is hashed and encrypted using strong cryptography algorithms and parameters

- Cryptography algorithms are seeded by PBKDF2 with 1M+ iterations from your password
- All storage keys are hashed using HMAC-SHA256, it is impossible to retrieve the original key
- All storage values are encrypted using AES-256-GCM, each with a different ciphertext/IV

### Authenticated storage

Some critical entities like private keys and seed phrases are stored in WebAuthn and require authentication (FaceID/TouchID)

- They are encrypted before being stored in WebAuthn storage
- Their reference ID and encryption IV are stored in encrypted storage (the one we talked above)

Nobody can access your private keys or seed phrases without your password + authentication (FaceID/TouchID)

This mitigates supply-chain attacks and phishing attacks, and prevents phone-left-on-the-table attacks
