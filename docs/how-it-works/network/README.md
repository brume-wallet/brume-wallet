### Safe Tor and TLS protocols

We use the Tor and the TLS protocols in a way that's mostly safe, even though they are not fully implemented nor audited

Keep in mind that the zero risk doesn't exist, and a highly motivated attacker could deanonymize you by doing the following steps (very unlikely to happen):

1. Owning the entry node, and logging all IP addresses using Brume Wallet, something he could know by:
  - Deep packet inspection, since our Tor/TLS packets may not be like those from regular Tor/TLS users
  - Behaviour analysis, since our Tor/TLS may not behave the same way as regular Tor/TLS implementations

2. Owning the JSON-RPC server, and logging all wallet addresses that used Tor

3. Correlating IP addresses logs with wallet addresses logs, and if both sides are small enough, linking a particular IP address to a particular wallet address
